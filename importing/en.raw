Thousands of demonstrators have marched through London to protest the war in
Iraq and demand the withdrawal of British troops from that country.
Families of soldiers killed in the conflict joined the protesters who carried
banners with such slogans as "Bush Number One Terrorist" and "Stop the
Bombings." They marched from the Houses of Parliament to a rally in Hyde Park.
Police put the number of marchers at 10,000 while organizers claimed it was
100,000.
The protest comes on the eve of the annual conference of Britain's ruling Labor
Party in the southern English seaside resort of Brighton. The party is divided
over Britain's participation in the Iraq conflict and the continued deployment
of 8,500 British troops in that country.
The London march came ahead of anti-war protests today in other cities,
including Rome, Paris, and Madrid.
